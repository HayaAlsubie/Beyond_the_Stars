Staff are friendly and courteous. The Egyptian Manager is also approachable. One of the best thing here, is that they serve free pica pica while waiting for food. This helps us to get rid of boredom and makes our small talks even more interesting. Menu here are consist of Southeast Asian and Arab cuisine.

The restaurant offers a variety of Yemeni dishes, including their signature chicken mandi. The mandi was flavorful and well-cooked, and the portion size was generous. We also tried the lamb mandi, which was equally delicious.

The restaurant is often crowded, especially during peak meal times. It is advisable to make a reservation in advance or be prepared to wait for a table.
The restaurant is self-service, so you will need to order your food at the counter and collect it yourself.

I found hair clips and bunches of hair. In my three days of stay I understood that they didn't know the concept of room service as they had come only once that too when we called them.
-When asked for water, they said the hotel ran out of it and that I'd have to pay for it. We were offered free breakfast from them through the website(Expedia) we had booked the tickets but they denied us that. I had to consult Expedia for this & I was told that I would be given credit for it. They tried contacting the hotel too but were left unanswered.
Prior to visiting this hotel, I had amazing experience with two other hotels in Mecca and Madinah who were impeccable with their customer service. Unfortunately, this hotel couldn't deliver anything. The staff at the reception was also very unenthusiastic.

I recently had the misfortune of staying at Raynat Al Abha Hotel, and I must warn others to avoid this establishment at all costs.

Despite paying for a 5-night stay, I was forced to cut my visit short to 4 nights due to the unacceptable level of service. The most glaring issue was the complete lack of cleaning services during my stay. Not a single day did the housekeeping staff attend to my room.

To make matters worse, when I politely requested the night shift receptionist from Bangladesh to arrange for my room to be cleaned, I was met with a shockingly rude response. The receptionist's unprofessional demeanor and behavior were appalling.

The utter disregard for customer satisfaction and basic hospitality standards at Raynat Al Abha Hotel is staggering. I strongly advise against visiting this hotel, and I hope that management takes immediate action to address these egregious issues.

Back then, it was a beautiful, serene destination, perfect for families and individuals seeking relaxation amidst nature. Unfortunately, my latest visit was deeply disappointing.

The most glaring issue is the cleanliness. The park is littered with garbage, making it unhygienic and unappealing for visitors. Benches and other facilities are either broken or poorly maintained, and the once lush green lawns now appear overgrown and untended. Such conditions make it difficult for families to enjoy quality time or for children to play safely.
Being a public park, it is disappointing to see such negligence. Parks like Abu Khayal should be prioritized as they provide a much-needed recreational space for locals and tourists alike. Regular maintenance, proper cleaning schedules, and functional facilities are essential to restore its charm.

We endured a staggering two-hour wait for our rooms, which was excruciating with restless kids in tow. To make matters worse, the reception staff were consistently rude and unhelpful. As a family, we had booked three separate rooms, but instead, they crammed two families into one room while relegating our other family members to the smallest, most inadequate room they had available. The next day, after much hassle, we finally got the three rooms we had originally booked, but the experience had already soured our entire stay. The rooms were disgustingly dirty, covered in layers of dust. The bathrooms were a complete mess, and the foul smell emanating from them was unbearable. This hotel couldn't even dream of calling itself a 4-star establishment; it's honestly the worst experience I've ever had. The service was consistently appalling, and to top it all off, the entire place was disgustingly dirty. It was a truly awful experience that I would never wish on anyone.

I recently stayed at this hotel (26/01/2025 to 01/02/2025) and, unfortunately, my experience was far from what I had anticipated. There were numerous issues that, combined, made my stay highly unpleasant.

First and foremost, the cleanliness of the room was appalling. The room was not only very dirty but also had a persistent, foul odor that made it difficult to stay in for extended periods. The bathroom, meanwhile, was poorly organized and far too cramped to be comfortable. The space was not conducive to any level of convenience or relaxation. No cups provided in the room for tea/coffee. Not even water provided.

Additionally, the elevator service was incredibly slow. On multiple occasions, it took at least 15 minutes to arrive at the third floor, which is a clear indication of poor maintenance or inadequate staffing.

Unfortunately, the situation worsened when I discovered bugs in the bed. This led to allergic reactions, making the already uncomfortable stay even more unbearable. When I brought this to the attention of the cleaning staff, I was met with an unhelpful and dismissive attitude. They refused to provide clean towels and also declined to clean the room and bathroom altogether, which is a basic expectation for any hotel.

As for the dining experience, it was disappointing. Though I had paid for the buffet, dinner service did not begin on time; it was consistently late by 15 minutes, which I found unacceptable. The buffet was also not properly replenished. When a food tray was emptied, it was not refilled, leaving those who arrived late with fewer options. For the price, the variety was adequate, but the lack of timely service and replenishment made the experience frustrating.

In addition, the hotel did not seem to enforce any discipline among guests. There was considerable noise throughout my stay, making it difficult to relax or get a good night's sleep.

While the location of the hotel is indeed convenient, the overall lack of attention to detail, customer service, and cleanliness leaves much to be desired. If I could rate this hotel lower than 1/10, I certainly would. As it stands, I would strongly advise others to reconsider staying here unless significant improvements are made.",en,"subject: extremely disappointing stay - unacceptable conditions and service

As for the service, it was just okay, again below what I would expect for the price. The staff were not particularly attentive or friendly, which added to the underwhelming experience.

However, the coffee shop does have one standout feature; its location and atmosphere. The view is absolutely excellent, and I really enjoyed the outdoor seating. The atmosphere was serene and perfect for relaxing, which somewhat made up for the other shortcomings.

In summary, while the view and atmosphere are top notch, the coffee, service, and pricing fall short.

When we entered our room, it was a disaster. The room was stinking terribly and intolerable odour from the toilet. The toilet pipes were stained.Fridge not working. No microwave in the room. We booked twin beds but got a single bed.
We requested for a transfer and the next 2 rooms had a similar issue. Bad odour from the toilets and rusted taps, Faucet pipe not working properly.
Felt disgusted to use the toilets during my entire stay.
Housekeeping staff are rude and they don't clean the rooms properly. With the mop used to wipe the toilet floor they swab the entire room floor.

Getting there is awful because of road closures etc.
Stranger Things experience was 1/10. Literally just the sofa with the letters on top and some smoke and you’re done. (Some people waited hours for that)
Squid game experience wasn’t that much better. We did the bridge game and the red/green light game. The bridge was stupid, you walk and if it goes red you jump off the side onto a soft landing. They only spoke Arabic and no one jumped off when it went red because they wanted to just walk over.
